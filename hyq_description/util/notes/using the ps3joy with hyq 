(assumes that you have already installed the ros-drivers/joystick_drivers
so that you have the ps3joy stuff in your ros distro, and have pulled and 
compiled the hyq_ps3joy repo)
the joy reading driver needs access to the bluetooth so either go root or give 
appropriate permissions... here we go root!
sudo bash
cd ~/blah_blah/iit_dlsl_hyq/hyq_ps3joy
roslaunch hyq_ps3joy.launch 
press the ps3 button on the joy pad and you should see smth like
...[][] Opened joystick ..blah...

then on another terminal type
rosrun hyq_ps3joy hyq_ps3joy

all is set on the ros side!

go to the RCF_with_planning_hyqgen0.1 branch in hyq_user
launch SL (xenoros/ros) and choose st/task: WCPG
stw to start trotting 
toggle_ROS_input to enable/disable the joypad control

take it easy if you're on the real robot ;)

enjoy,
